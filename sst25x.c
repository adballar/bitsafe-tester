/** \file sst25x.c
  *
  * \brief Provides access to the SST25x series of serial flash memory chips.
  *
  * The SST25x series of serial flash memory chips are a group of external,
  * non-volatile memory chips from Silicon Storage Technology. Using
  * external (i.e. not integrated with the microcontroller) memory offers
  * more design flexibility, is typically more reliable and is cheaper (on a
  * cost-per-kilobyte basis) than internal memory.
  *
  * The functions in this file provide low-level, raw access to the flash
  * memory. Here "low-level" means that erase and program operations must occur
  * with sector granularity (see #SECTOR_SIZE) and no wear-levelling is
  * performed. Before calling any other function, initSST25x() must be called.
  *
  * While the code here is written for the SST25x series, other serial flash
  * memory chips (eg. from Winbond) have very similar interfaces. Thus the
  * code can probably be adapted to other serial flash memory chips relatively
  * easily.
  *
  * For hardware interfacing requirements, see initSST25x(). All references
  * to the "PIC32 family reference manual" refer to Section 23 (Serial
  * Peripheral Interface), revision G, obtained from
  * http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/61106G.pdf on
  * 15 November 2012. All references to the "SST25VF080B datasheet" refer
  * to revision A, obtained from
