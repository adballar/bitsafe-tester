/** \file usb_standard_requests.c
  *
  * \brief Handles standard USB requests directed to the control endpoint.
  *
  * A USB device is required to handle standard requests sent as control
  * transfers to endpoint 0 (the "control endpoint"). These standard requests
  * facilitate device enumeration and are described in chapter 9 of the
  * USB specification. This file handles those standard requests. It handles
  * a next-to-minimal set of requests: Clear Feature (endpoint halt only),
  * Get Configuration, Get Descriptor, Get Status, Set Address,
  * Set Configuration and Set Feature (endpoint halt only).
  *
  * Some notes about the implemented requests:
  * - Set/Get Configuration, Get Descriptor and Set Address are essential
  *   for device enumeration and configuration. When you plug in a USB device,
  *   it will likely receive the Get Descriptor, Set Address and
  *   Set Configuration requests.
  * - The set is next-to-minimal because as part of the Get Descriptor request,
  *   string descriptors are implemented (they're not strictly necessary).
  *   String descriptors are implemented to make device identification easier.
  * - Clear Feature, Set Feature and Get Status are required to implement
  *   the "endpoint halt" feature, which is required for interrupt
  *   endpoints (see section 9.4.5 of the USB specification).
  * - Only a single configuration (with configuration value = 1) and a single
  *   interface is supported.
  *
  * All references to the "USB specification" refer to revision 2.0, obtained
  * from http://www.usb.org/developers/docs/usb_20_110512.zip (see usb_20.pdf)
  * on 26 March 2012.
