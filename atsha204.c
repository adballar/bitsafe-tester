  *
  * \brief Driver for Atmel CryptoAuthentication (ATSHA204) chip.
  *
  * The ATSHA204 is a security device which features, among other things, an
  * internal hardware random number generator and the ability to calculate
  * hashes of various chunks of data. Because it is hardened against physical
  * attack, the ATSHA204 can be used to increase the physical security of a
  * hardware Bitcoin wallet. The ATSHA204's internal hardware random number
  * generator can also be used as a source of entropy.
  *
  * The functions in this file provide a software interface to a subset of
  * the ATSHA204's capabilities. For hardware interfacing requirements, see
  * initATSHA204(). To use the functions in this file, first call
  * initATSHA204() once. After that, all the other functions may be used. Note
  * that as described in section 8.1.6 of the ATSHA204 datasheet, the ATSHA204
  * features a watchdog timer which puts the device to sleep periodically.
  * Thus the recommended sequence of calls is: atsha204Wake(), do actual stuff
  * atsha204Sleep().
  *
  * All references to the "ATSHA204 datasheet" refer to document revision
  * 8740D, obtained from http://www.atmel.com/images/doc8740.pdf on
  * 17 November 2012.
