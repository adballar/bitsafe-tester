  *
  * \brief USB HID class driver which transfers data as a stream.
  *
  * This file implements a device-side USB HID class driver which transfers
  * data in a manner similar to the Silicon Labs CP2110. In a nutshell,
  * a data stream is broken up into chunks of maximum size 63 bytes, and those
  * chunks are sent as a bunch of HID reports where the report ID is the
  * chunk size. This is an abuse of the HID specification, but things are
  * done this way to allow "driverless" operation on Windows systems.
  *
  * Here's a high-level overview of what's provided in this file. There is
  * an implementation of streamGetOneByte() and streamPutOneByte(), which
  * read from or write to FIFOs. The interface to USB happens mainly through
  * callbacks, because USB is fundamentally asynchronous from a device's point
  * of view. The nature of asynchronous I/O means that care must be taken to
  * only queue (i.e. schedule) transfers if the appropriate FIFO is empty
  * or full enough. Things are complicated by the fact that the host can
  * get and send reports through both the Interrupt endpoints and the control
  * endpoint.
  *
  * Some additional notes:
  * - Care must be taken to avoid race conditions, since many of the callbacks
  *   can occur in an interrupt context. The assumption is made that there
  *   is only one interrupt context (i.e. USB interrupts cannot interrupt
  *   USB interrupts).
  * - If the host decides to get/send reports through an Interrupt endpoint
  *   and the control endpoint simultaneously, the order of reports is
  *   undefined (so don't do that!).
  * - It is necessary to support the "Set Report" control request
  *   (see setReport()) because the hidraw driver on Linux kernels
  *   earlier than 2.6.35 use it, even if the device provides a perfectly
  *   working Interrupt OUT endpoint.
  *

  * bits and nothing the caller can do will fix that.
